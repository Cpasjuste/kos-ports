This is a partial implementation of OpenGL 1.2 for the SEGA Dreamcast for use
with the KallistiOS SDK.

It began as a fork of libGL by Josh Pearson but has undergone a large refactor
which is essentially a rewrite.

The aim is to implement as much of OpenGL 1.2 as possible, and to add additional
features via extensions.
